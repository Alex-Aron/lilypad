# Rust + Antlr Test

A rough test of using antlr grammars in Rust.

`build.rs` will generate the appropriate files from the antlr grammar given `antlr4-4.8-2-SNAPSHOT-complete.jar` is in the root directory (download from [here](https://github.com/rrevenantt/antlr4rust/releases/tag/antlr4-4.8-2-Rust-0.2))

Currently uses a fork of Antlr4Rust because it does not yet have support for new versions of rust.
